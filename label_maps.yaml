          Recruiters really tick me off
          Its 9am on a weekend and I'm already ticked off. I came across a post on LinkedIn that said recruiters should dress up as ghosts because they ghost candidates. Do recruiters really think this kind of stuff is funny?

          Emotionally exhausted from this BS market
          I just need to rant. I never cried so much within a week until now. I have bills to pay, rent is over 2k for a studio, there are no jobs here. I am so tired because this job market is exhausting and everyone is saying its fine.

          Mind blowing "counter" from employer
          So I'm officially employed as a sales rep on $47k/year, but I've been doing the responsibilities and tasks of the sales manager AND operations manager all year. Both of these official positions have technically been available, but my boss just hasn't bothered hiring for them. I recently got a new job that I start in 2 weeks, which is going to pay me just over $99k/year with additional benefits and allowances. The day after I resigned last week, my boss came at me with the "official" promotion to the role I'm doing - $55K. I declined, obviously. He seemed shocked, told me that the money shouldn't be a factor, that I've built up such a great reputation here I'd be throwing my "career" away (I've been there for less than 2 years). I told him that it's insulting at this point, and that if he had offered me the position a few months ago I wouldn't have started job searching and would've been elated. I advised him to reward people when it's due, not when you're going to lose them. Now as a result, the location I work at is going to be shut down because he can't find anyone to replace me and the other managers are leaving with me. Karma is sweet.

          As a recent college graduate, I thought it wouldn't be that hard to find a job that paid $20 an hour that but I was wrong. There are no entry level jobs in my field or any job that could potentially get my foot in the door pay so little. What is the point of having a college degree if full time jobs won't even allow me to move out and rent a room.

          What would be considered a decent salary for an apartment costing $1000 per month?
          Title says it all. Whatâ€™s a decent one (while still having fun money, can save, feel comfortable)?? And what would be the minimum salary for the same apartment, where I could still get by, but fun would be decreased significantly/eating habits would change.

          Pretty large raise at work
          I am a 24-year-old working as an HR Assistant/ Recruiter at a well-endowed Non-Profit. I finished an MBA (that was paid for in full by my org) I almost immediately received a massive raise that increased my comp from 50k to 65k. I also work a part-time 1-day week job that will net just shy of 5K this year. I pay around 1K a month for rent and have about 56k remaining in private student loans. Does anyone have any advice for paying down my loans while growing my bank account? I also maintain a 403B and a Roth that I would consider increasing my contributions but would like to grow savings first due to the expensive city I live in.
